# Calculator Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum and involves creating a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator includes basic arithmetic operations and additional functionality to handle edge cases and user interactions.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Operate on two numbers with a selected operator.
- Display results and handle edge cases such as dividing by zero.
- Clear functionality to reset the calculator.
- Rounded answers to prevent display overflow for long decimals.
- Handles consecutive operator inputs intelligently.

### Extra Features (if implemented):

- Support for decimal inputs using a `.` button.
- Backspace button for undoing the last input.
- Keyboard support for seamless user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, the following skills will be developed and demonstrated:

- Building and styling user interfaces with HTML and CSS.
- Writing modular and reusable JavaScript functions.
- Managing state and data flow in a web application.
- Debugging and handling edge cases in user interactions.
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```
2. Open the project folder and double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
3. Use the calculator interface to perform operations.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, percentages).
- Improve UI with animations and themes.
- Add scientific calculator functionality.
